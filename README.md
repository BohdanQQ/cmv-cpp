Based on 

* [Distinct Elements in Streams: An Algorithm for
the (Text) Book (Chakraborty, Vinodchandran, Meel) 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10191)

* [Donald Knuth's notes on the paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/cvm-note.pdf)


## Build & Run

Copy the include files to your project and include them in your code.

Or, compile the source files in `src` and `include` with a `c++20`-compatible compiler. The executable will run a bunch of examples, see `main.cpp` for details.

TODO Cmake?

TODO Tests
